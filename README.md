# Deeplog-log_anomaly_detection
日志异常检测，Used for log anomaly detection, including log preprocessing, training, prediction, and output results.
## Introduction
***This work is developed on the basis of <https://github.com/d0ng1ee/logdeep>, and use [Drain](https://github.com/logpai/logparser) for log parsing.***  
## Major features  
- Used for producing environment.  
- Including complete process.  
- Outputing anomaly logs, rather than precision, recall, F1-score and so on.  
## Requirement  
- python>=3.6  
- pytorch >= 1.1.0  
## Quick start  
1. Preprocess logs

   ```
   cd demo  
   python preprocess.py
   ```
   Then you will get the parsed log file at `../result/parse_result`, and `length of event_id_map` represents the count of log templates, `../data/demo_input.csv` is the file where the EventId has been mapped to numbers starting from 1  

3. Train model

   ```
   python deeplog.py train
   ```
   It will tain using `../data/demo_input.csv` and the result, key parameters and train logs will be saved under `result/deeplog` path

4. Predict and output anomaly result

   ```
   python deeplog.py predict
   ```
   It will predict using `name = 'demo_input.csv'` in `predict.py`, here I am using the same file for both training and prediction, but you can change it as needed.😁   
   The anomaly output will be saved as `../result/anomaly_output_for_xxx.csv`.
