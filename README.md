# Deeplog-log_anomaly_detection
日志异常检测，Used for log anomaly detection, including log preprocessing, training, prediction, and output results.
## Introduction
Used for log anomaly detection, including log processing, training, prediction, and output results.
This work is developed on the basis of <https://github.com/d0ng1ee/logdeep>, and use [Drain](https://github.com/logpai/logparser) for log parsing.  
## Major features  
Used for producing environment.
Including complete process.  
Outputing anomaly logs, rather than precision, recall, F1-score and so on.  
## Requirement  
python>=3.6
pytorch >= 1.1.0  
## Quick start  
Preprocess logs
